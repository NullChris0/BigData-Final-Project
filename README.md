# BigData Final Project

## Overview
This is our project for course "_Big Data Analytics and Mining@cirly_", it aims to explore techniques for processing, analyzing, and mining large datasets. Throughout this project, we'll delve into tasks such as data collection, cleaning, feature extraction, model development, and result visualization.

## Structure
- `~/`: Main working directory
- `data/`: Contains raw data files and preprocessed datasets.
- `utils/`: Contains source code for data processing, feature extraction, model training, etc.
- `results/`: Stores model prediction results, visualization charts, and other output files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python library dependencies for the project.

## Usage
1. Clone the project to your local environment.
2. Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run source code files for data processing, feature extraction, and model training.
4. Analyze the results and save them in the `results/` directory.
